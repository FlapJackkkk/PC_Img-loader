Make a 39x39 screen made of 1x1 blocks, make sure the rgb is |248, 248, 248| this is what the script will be detecting for.

On this specific line make sure to edit it based off of your platform and executor (capitals and lowercases matter)
JSON_OUTPUT = "/Users/YOURNAME/Downloads/Xeno Workspace/image_data.json"

Load the python script first then once you have launched execute the lua script. And everything should work.

When you put your your image in the folder name it input.jpg or it will fail.

To run it, go to the live_converter.py file, open terminal, and type 
python3 ./live_converter.py

The image in the folder is just a placeholder lol.
Made with the help of gemini and my dumbass self.

Not serverside :C   -still cool
